# BBSshapefile
This package was created to download and do some basic processing of Breeding Bird Survey data with R. 

Currently, the package will download data from the internet and pull in a shapefile or raster of the interpolated abundance data or a probability surface of abundance.

Using bird abundance as a prior probability surface in conjuction with other spatially explicit data - such as stable-hydrogen isotopes or archival light-level geolocators has been increasing in recent years. This package makes it easy to download the data, and align the data with the raster of stable-hydrogen isotopes in precipitation. 

The package is still in its infancy but the core function BBSmap is functional.
